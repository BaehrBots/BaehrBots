### **üéØ Our Mission: Stabilizing the Grid with AI**

BaehrBots provides AI-driven solutions to automate and optimize power trading processes. We specialize in managing energy storage and integrating renewable energy efficiently, ensuring grid stability by balancing supply and demand.

<details>
<summary><strong>Learn more about the energy challenge we solve</strong></summary>
<br>
A significant portion of today's electricity comes from renewable sources like wind and photovoltaics. However, due to weather fluctuations, these are not steady electricity suppliers. Since the power grid must always operate at 50 Hertz to avoid Europe-wide blackouts, the fluctuations from renewables must be balanced in real-time. To enable this ongoing frequency regulation, supply and demand in the power grid must be continuously balanced. Therefore, energy providers have traders who are responsible for buying and selling electricity around the clock in fifteen-minute intervals. Flexible power plants such as pumped-storage power plants or large batteries are needed to supply electricity to the grid when wind and solar energy are insufficient or to absorb excess electricity.
